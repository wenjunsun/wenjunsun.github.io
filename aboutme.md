subtitle: A software engineer, data scientist, and computational neuroscientist who tries to make this world a better place.

My name is Hugh Sun. I am passionate about many many things, which includes but are not limited to, neuroscience, education, computer system, math, machine learning, and data science.
I am currently an undergraduate student at University of Washington studying computer science. I deeply care about humanity and think technology can help us combat climate change, poverty, and much more, if we use it the right way. I believe technology should benefit everyone on earth and not just the priviledged few. 

### My story
- I am currently doing data analysis research on how government policy impacts people's behavior throughour COVID 19.
