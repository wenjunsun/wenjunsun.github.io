**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template for creating a beautiful website quickly, developed by Dean Attali. If you want to use this template, please go to Beautiful Jecyll github page and clone it there.

# My notes
1. consult [this github](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) for more information of how to change my website and add more stuff to it
2. index.html controls the main page (entry point) of my web.
3. how to write latex: 
- $$\LaTeX code$$   (for inline display)
- \\[\LaTeX code\\] (stand alone line display)
- \\(\LaTeX code\\) (for inline)
